  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I have enjoyed various responsibilities that include planning and carrying out scientific experiments, culturing mammalian cells in an aseptic environment, the planning and carrying out of an Animal Model involving Wistar rats, molecular and cell biology, and microscopy protocols. <br> My research has followed a focus in diabetic research, with an interest in medicinal plant extracts, especially those that have been traditionally used in indigenous communities.
    <br> I have presented experimental results and findings at various conferences locally and internationally. I attended the International Diabetes Federation Congress, held in Abu Dhabi in 2017, where my abstract was accepted to be presented as a poster. <br>The work from my PhD will be incorporated into various articles that will focus on the various aspects of research. Being avidly interested in not only science but scientific engagement, I have been involved in various science communication platforms such as ThreeMinuteThesis and FameLab.
    <br> In addition, I have contributed science-based news articles to the university newspaper on a regular basis. As of this year, I have completed a short course in Science Communication: Trends, Innovations and Challenges, which was offered at Stellenbosch University.
    <br> Having been active in a research environment for 5+ years, this has exposed me to good lab practice, as well as interacting with various undergraduate students through a variety of tutoring, demonstrating and supervisory roles, which allowed me to pass on vital sets of knowledge and share my passion for science.
